### JupyterDemo
Jupyter Notebook/Lab Demo

This a collection of simple jupyter notebooks to use for a demo.

I'm going to test the notebooks using a conda environment.  I've 
exported the environment to environment.yml.  You should be able
to create an identical environment by typing:

    `conda create -n jupyter-demo -f environment.yml`
