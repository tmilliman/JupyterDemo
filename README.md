# JupyterDemo
Jupyter Notebook/Lab Demo

This a collection of simple jupyter notebooks to use for a demo.

I'm going to test the notebooks using a conda environment.  Here
are the steps I used to set up the conda environment.

    conda create -n jupyter_demo python=3.7
    conda activate jupyter_demo
    conda install --channel conda-forge
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
    conda install r-base
